                Introduction
            </h2>
            <h3>
                My name is Ryan, I am from <u>Toronto, Ontario</u>
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am currently a high schooler in grade 10 who plans on pursuing a degree in CS or SE and possibly at the prestigous University of Waterloo. The purpose of this website as well as my <a href="https://github.com/ryan-thecoolio">github account</a> is to grow my progamming skills. Currently I have some experience using <u>Python, HTML, &amp CSS.</u>

            <h2>
                Experience
            </h2>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier in my introduction, I have learned python, however, it is limited to the <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/">'CS Academy Library.'</a> While I also learned how to use the console in python to problem solve and compute these tasks given certain restrictions, I primarily relied on pre-built functions to make a game
                
                <br><br>

                The two games I have listed below were made in Gr 10 for my the course of 'Introduction to Computer Studies' (ICD2O). I had a lot of fun in this class and hope to learn more next year!

                <br><br><br><br>
                First, this is a game where I attempted to build geometry dash called <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/peruDog1325">'Math Game.'</a> To play, you simply click space to avoid the red, dangerous kill spikes. You have as many attempts, but each stage gets more and more difficult! 
                <br><br>
                Since this was my first game, I did not expect to encounter so many bugs (some of which are still not patched). As a result, there is only one level! PS. I added a math question to suite the title 'Math Game!'
                <br><br>

                <br><br><br><br>
                Another, game I tried to make was inspired by 'Tiny Tanks' as well as <a href="https://tankionline.com">'Tanki Online</a> (a game I used to play when I was young). It is a two-player game where every time the enemy is shot, they lose a life. If you lose all 5 lives, the other player wins!
                <br><br>
                Now that I had more experience with the library, I calculated the player's rotation using sine and cosine rules! This made the code more effecient and clean. However, there is still bugs in the game...

                This is my first ever website I have created other than a demo website that I made following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5QFHp1oAws">youtube tutorial.</a> The video taught me the foundations of HTML and CSS including how to layout text using div blocks.
